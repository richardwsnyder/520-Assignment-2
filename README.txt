Compile program: javac *.java 
this will compile all of the java files in the folder

Run program: java Search <ALG> <FILE>
File must be specified in the relative path to where the code is being run from.
For example, if the code is being run from ~/Downloads/richardsnyderAssignment2/ and the
test files are in ~/Downloads/Assign2Files/,
You must run the program as so: java Search BFS ../Assign2Files/PuzzleN-1.mb





This program outputs the end result data to a file <ALG>output.txt, where <ALG> is either BFS or AStar,
depending on which algorithm you passed in as a command line parameter.

As described by my console output for RBFS, I did not implement it, as I did not have enough time come the
assignment due date. I accept whatever point deductions come from that fact. 

Please provide feedback for this program, as I'm very interested to know how my implementation could've 
been improved in any way. I accept whatever grade I receive, but I'd certainly like for it to be a learning
experience and not just an assignment turned in and forgotten about. 

I've commented the code where I think necessary, so I hope they're helpful in reading my code. 

Please be gracious in grading
